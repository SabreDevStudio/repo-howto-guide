# Repo How to Guide

## Overview

This repo serves as some helpful advice for our teams offering sample source code to our public-facing GitHub account.


## Why Add a Repo to the @SabreDevStudio Account

Because you have a source code repo that is a sample, example, or other teaching artifact enabling a customer to learn how to use one of our APIs, SDKs, or developer-oriented product offerings. 

## Naming Convention

Naming a repo helps a viewer understand two things: what Sabre product it uses, and what programming language it is written in. Pick any name that helps convey meaning at first glance. 

Use these two conventions to help make our project repos look like they all belong together:  

  * shish-kabob-case
  * product-repotype-language or API-language
 

## Importance of README.md

One of the most important files in your source code repo is the **README.md** file. It introduces your project by telling people answers for questions they might have such as:

* Why does this source code repo exist?
* How does it add value to a person, team, or company?
* What does it look like when it's running?
* What are the steps for installing, configuring, and using it?
* Where is the Sabre-technology in this?

### Best-practices for README.md authors:

* Approach with a beginner's mind
* Get a programmer up-and-running quickly
* Consider an audience of:
  * Architect
  * Development Manager
  * Product Manager
  * Software Developer
* Provide pictures showing: 
  * How it looks running
  * What the architecture overview is
* Leverage HTML: links to reference pages, rich text formatting, images

## Suggested General Outline:

Look to the [template README.md](./README%20template.md) for an example outline. Use it to help you get started writing your own README. You will see a basic structure that you can adapt for your source code's needs.
