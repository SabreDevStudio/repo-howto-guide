# Repo How to

## Overview

This repo serves as some helpful advice for our teams offering sample source code to our public-facing GitHub account.


## Why Add a Repo to the @SabreDevStudio Account

// TODO

Because the source code repo is a sample, example, teaching artifact for a customer learning how to use one of our web service APIs. 

## Naming Convention

## Importance of README.md

One of the most important files in your source code repo is the **README.md** file. It introduces your project by telling people:

* Why does this source code repo exist in the world?
* How does it add value to a person, team, or company?
* What does it look like when it's running?
* What are the steps for installing, configuring, and using it?
* Where is the Sabre-power in this?

## Best-practices for README.md authors:
* Approach with a beginner's mind
* Get a programmer up-and-running quickly
* Consider an audience of:
  * Architect
  * Programmer
  * Product Manager
  * Development Manager
* Provide some pictures showing: it running, architectural overview diagram
* Leverage HTML: links to reference pages, rich text formatting, images

Look to the [template README.md](./README%20template.md) for an example outline to help you get started writing your own. You will see a basic structure that you can adapt for your source code's needs.
